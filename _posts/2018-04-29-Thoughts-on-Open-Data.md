It is just awesome! so much information available for everyone to use but it is not just about having it available

# What it is Open Data and why I started to like it

It's as simple as having free data for anyone to use and that is easily accessible. This means for example the government would publish a lot of information from their own institutions to everyone! It is awesome since everyone will be able to take a look at what it is actually going on 

## Open Data files

Open Data is not just publishing a PDF but being able to search for the right Data set and have it available in a niche machine readable file ( Not only that but I'll get into that later )

## Open Data List

These are just a few of places where you can get a lot of data!

* [Open Data Mexico](https://datos.gob.mx/).
* [Open Data Spain](http://datos.gob.es/).
* [GapMinder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/).
* [WorldBank](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/databases.aspx).
* [WorldBank](https://datausa.io/search/?kind=soc).
* [Open Data Inception](https://opendatainception.io/).

# What's left then?

Well there's still a lot of things to do regarding Open Data it is true that having APIs, everything in nice CSV files and even having Spark endpoints it is really awesome but it is just not enough for everyone.

The idea of having Open Data is for everyone to not only use it but to understand it, so keep in mind that not everyone knows how to use an API and even less people know how ot use Spark endpoints or RDF files. It's not just about having the datasets there but also adding visualizations for everyone to understand it.

Adding some visualizations is something not everyone is doing right now but again, it should be asked the same way we ask for a CSV file or a RDF file so it's possible for everyone to get some insights from that information.

Some Open Data projects are starting to include the visualizations and that it's what, in my own opinion, makes them really awesome for going beyond of just sharing some information

## What can you do?

Start building visualizations! Do not get only a nice dataset, publish it with something that is visually attractive to everyone

There still a lot of Open Data from a lot of government or institutions that require a good visualization so let's start doing that with everydataset that we get in our hands. Just with using a simple Data wrangler and a Data visualization tool there's so much that can be done with an Open Data Set

* [Trifacta: Data Wrangler](https://www.trifacta.com/products/wrangler/).
* [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).

These are some of the things that can be generated when using those really simple tools:

* [Barcelona bus stations](https://public.tableau.com/profile/edgar.ochoa#!/vizhome/BusstationsinBarcelona/Dashboard1).
* [Barcelona WiFi,Parking lots, Tourist rooms, Recharge points](https://public.tableau.com/profile/edgar.ochoa#!/vizhome/Barcelonapoints/Dashboard1).
