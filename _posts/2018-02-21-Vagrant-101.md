I'll be now using Vagrant to create a simple Ubuntu trusty64 and set up Apache to redirect port 80 to our local machine and make some HTML changes to it

## What's Vagrant?

Vagrant is a powerfull tool when it comes to virtualization and working with different environments, in this blog it will help me to set up testing envirionments

## Why Vagrant?

Because it's really easy to manage VMs using it! More info [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

# Let's get started

Using Vagrant is really easy as long as we know the basic stuff about a server so I'll try to explain the best as I can all the steps taken when creating this Vagrant machine that will help as a template later

## 1. Start our project. Let's create our folder where we will be working and where we will commit our changes

```bash
# Creating the folder
mkdir vagrant-apache-template
# Navigate to the folder
cd vagrant-apache-template
# Initialize this folder as a Git project
git init
```

## 2. Initialize Vagrant project. 
Now let's create the Vagrant project

```bash
vagrant init
```

We now have the basic and we should be able to execut commands such as vagrant up to get our server started but first let's player around with the file named "Vagrantfile"

## 3. Set up our server. 
Modify the existing file with the following:
 ```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # Here we are asking for a box using ubuntu/trusyt64 release
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.ssh.insert_key = false

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # This will be the name of our VM
    vb.name = "apache"
    # Setting the Memory in mb, WARNING try not to use more memory than your actual machine has
    vb.memory = "1024"
  end
 end
```

## 4. Start our server. 
We should now be able to run the command*:
```bash
vagrant up
```
*The first time this command is run it will take some time since it will download all the Ubuntu trusty64 image

## 5. Testing our Server. Once it's done we can SSH to our new machine using:
```bash
vagrant ssh
```

Now we have our own virtual machine running Ubuntu and make any changes needed to exit you can either close the terminal or type "exit"

Once we are outside our server we now need to set up our machine to use Apache and make some redirects to our local folder so let's destroy the machine for now using
```bash
vagrant destroy
```

## 6. Improving our server with some local network connection. 

Some changes to our vagrant file this will allow our machine to be visible through our local network
 ```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # Here we are asking for a box using ubuntu/trusyt64 release
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.ssh.insert_key = false

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # This will be the name of our VM
    vb.name = "apache"
    # Setting the Memory in mb, WARNING try not to use more memory than your actual machine has
    vb.memory = "1024"
  end
  
  # Forwarding our host port 8080 to our guest port 80
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
  config.vm.network "public_network", type: "dhcp"
  
 end
```
When we start our machine it will ask to which network adapter our virtual machine should have access to our local network

## 7. Adding provision script
Let's modify once more our Vagrant file to this
```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # Here we are asking for a box using ubuntu/trusyt64 release
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.ssh.insert_key = false

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    # This will be the name of our VM
    vb.name = "apache"
    # Setting the Memory in mb, WARNING try not to use more memory than your actual machine has
    vb.memory = "1024"
  end
  
  # Forwarding our host port 8080 to our guest port 80
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
  config.vm.network "public_network", type: "dhcp"
  
    # Setting the provision script that will be run when starting our machine
  config.vm.provision :shell, path: "./provision/bootstrap.sh"
 end
```

And add the script in our working directory using the following commands in terminal:
```bash
mkdir provision
cd provision
touch bootstrap.sh
```

The bootstrap.sh should look something like this:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Get updates
sudo apt-get update
# Install apache
sudo apt-get -y install apache2

# So we do not get "Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name" error
echo "ServerName myVagrant" | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf-available/servername.conf

# Restarting apache
sudo service apache2 reload

# Print the VM IP address
ip addr show eth1 | egrep "inet\ " | cut -f1 -d "/" | cut -f2 -d "t"
```
Now when we start our server automatically the virtual machine will run the script in provision/bootstrap.sh. This script install automatically apache and displays an IP address at the end so we can know the IP address of our VM in our local network

## 8. Linking a guest folder to a host folder

First we need the folder where our html will be linked to so let's creat an index and a folder
```bash
mkdir html
cd html
touch index.html
```

In our index.html file we need some basic HTML to display
```html
<html>
<header><title>This is my awesome VM</title></header>
<body>
Hello world using Vagrant!
</body>
</html>
```
Let's now make the final changes to our bootstrap.sh
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Get updates
sudo apt-get update
# Install apache
sudo apt-get -y install apache2

# So we do not get "Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name" error
echo "ServerName myVagrant" | sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf-available/servername.conf

# Link /vagrant/html to /var/www/html
sudo rm -rf /var/www/html
sudo ln -s /vagrant/html /var/www

# Restarting apache
sudo service apache2 reload

# Print the VM IP address
ip addr show eth1 | egrep "inet\ " | cut -f1 -d "/" | cut -f2 -d "t"
```

Now wen we start our server we should be able to see our index.html file as the landing page for our server using our browser
If you want to know how the whole project you can find it [here](https://github.com/edgaroc30/vagrant-apache-template)
In case you are more interested in using Nginx here's an [example using Nginx](https://github.com/edgaroc30/vagrant-nginx-template)

Some stuff that can bee added to the provision script:
```bash
# Install apache
sudo apt-get -y install apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2

# Install git
sudo apt-get -y install git

# Install MySQL
sudo debconf-set-selections <<< 'mysql-server-5.5 mysql-server/root_password password root'
sudo debconf-set-selections <<< 'mysql-server-5.5 mysql-server/root_password_again password root'
sudo apt-get -y install mysql-server libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql

# Install PHP
sudo apt-get -y install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt
```
