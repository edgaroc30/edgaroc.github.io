I started this blog as a reminder to myself how I made and set up multiple stuff during all this awesome learning path

First of all I am using this [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as a repository so just in case I forget where to find more information about the folder structure or something

Some basic stuff to remember when edditing this blog:

```
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png) // this is how you add a reference to an image in the project

These are the headers:
## Header 2 
### Header 3
#### Header 4

```
